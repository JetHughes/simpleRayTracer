  * \brief Class for Torus objects.
  *
  * This class provides an Object which is a Torus centred at the origin with outer radius 1
  * and a user-specified inner radius in the range \f$(0,1)\f$, as shown below.
  *
  * \image html torus.png
  * 
  * For a torus as shown in the figure, with a main radius (the centre line of the donut) of 1,
  * and an inner radius (the thickness of the donut) of \f$r\f$,
  * the surface is defined by the quartic (order 4) equation
  * \f$(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1 + r^2)^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2)\f$.
  * 
  * Note that the Torus provided in the skeleton code is not complete and returns no
  * RayIntersection%s from intersect(). This method needs to be implemented correctly
  * as part of the assignment.
